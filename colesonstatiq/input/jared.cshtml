            <h2>Hi I'm Jared</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I love learning new things.</p>
                <p>I can often be found walking nature trails with my son, usually while listening to history podcasts or audiobooks. I enjoy cooking, although I am still learning. My farming ancestors would be disappointed in our small East Texas farm. The only thing I can seem to grow is hay &amp; pine trees. I love traveling and exploring new cities, museums, restaurants, zoos, wineries, and breweries.</p>

            <h2>I'm a Software Developer</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Software should be people focused. A program or site that is hard to use, no matter how well written the code, is useless. Throughout my career I've tried to write software to make people's lives easier. It's my primary goal.</p>
                <p>I complied and ran my first program by copying the code for a game out of a book in elementary school.  In middle school, I used Teach Yourself C in 21 days to write my first fully functional program from scratch. It was a save game file edit for my favorite game at the time, Master of Orion. In high school, I started writing scripts to assist my boss in downtime at our office.  Eventually, that lead to writing a complete CRUD application that they used to track licenses and renewals for over ten years.  e/p>
